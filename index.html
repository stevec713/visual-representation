                <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                <p>Through the assignments, I learned about my passion for helping others and was able to apply that to my professional and personal life.  I was also able to effectively plan out my future and the goals that I want to achieve.  I want to use my web development knowledge to make products that will improve the lives of others.  My classmates gave me solid advice: to work hard but also to make time for myself.  This will give me the time and energy to stay motivated, achieve success and positively impact the lives of others.</p>
